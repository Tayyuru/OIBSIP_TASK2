                <p>
                    <b>Narendra Damodardas Modi</b> born 17th September 1950 is an Indian politician who is the 14th and current 
                    Prime Minister of India, in office since May 2014. He was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, and 
                    is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi. Modi, a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is a Hindu nationalist 
                    and member of the right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Born to a Gujarati family in Vadnagar, Modi helped his father sell tea as a child, and later ran his 
                    own stall. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight, beginning a long association with the 
                    organisation. He left home after graduating from school, partly because of an arranged marriage which 
                    he rejected. Modi traveled around India for two years, and visited a number of religious centres. 
                    He returned to Gujarat and moved to Ahmedabad in 1969 or 1970. In 1971 he became a full-time worker 
                    for the RSS. During the state of emergency imposed across the country in 1975, Modi was forced to go 
                    into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985, and he held several positions within the party
                    hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.
